# Leaflet-Challenge
This challenge was for Data Analytics Bootcamp to use USGS earthquake data to create a world map with multiple layers. To do this, we were given a HTML shell and required to write our own JS code using the Leaflet library. Other requirements included to make sure the markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquite by their size and depth by color, to add a layer illustrating the techtonic plates, and to have makers with relevant data.
